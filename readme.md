## Artificial Intelegence
- TTS AI Code Assistant. You will start coding and right off it will work somewhat like github copilot. You can ask for help at any time with the AI. The AI will have TTS and will work somewhat like open interprater. 

Lets have a scenario here. Say you run your code, and there is an error. For example

```lua
for i = 1, 100 dp
    print(i)
end
```

The AI will say something like this: "It appears there is a fualt in your code on line 1. It looks like there is an issue with the for loop. You have spelt do incorrectly and instead you wrote "dp". Can I fix this for you?"

Valid Responces: Yes, No. This will also work if you say something like its fine, go ahead, etc.
